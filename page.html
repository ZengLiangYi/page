					<h3>Welcome to my Harmolic Collection!</h3>
					<p>
						In my Harmolic Collection, I capture the everyday moments of a semester through weekly
						entries detailing what I ate and did.
					</p>

					<p>
						I really enjoy focusing on the ordinary things in life; these small things make my
						happiness tangible and give me a greater sense of the reality of living.
					</p>

					<p>
						This project, more than a diary, is a reflection on my life journey and a vessel for
						memories. I hope through this project, you may find the beauty in the ordinary and
						consider the narrative potential of your daily lives, celebrating the routine as a
						meaningful part of experience.

								In the first week of my sophomore year, I felt a bit nervous😓. After class, I
								passed by Fishs Eddy, a really interesting home goods store. Ever since I was
								little, I've always loved these kind of delicate and cute tableware. I also passed
								by a second-hand tableware store where a pink teapot was displayed on the sidewalk.
								It was incredibly cute.
							</p>
							<p>
								At home, I felt a bit bored and started playing cards with my boyfriend. We used a
								deck of Crayon Shin-chan themed playing cards that we bought during our summer trip
								to Jeju Island. The designs on the cards are just too creative and cute. 🃏

I really can\'t resist these cute dishes.</p><p>Guess who I went to see in concert: Billie Eilish! ！She has been my idol since elementary school, starting from her song "Six Feet Under." I\'ve witnessed her transformation from a music-loving little girl into a Grammy-winning music superstar. Now, experiencing her concert in person, I was moved to tears, feeling incredibly emotional about the whole journey.</p><p>This week also marked a significant day, October 18th, the second anniversary🩷 with my boyfriend.
