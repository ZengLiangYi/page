Ever since I was little, I've always loved these kind of delicate and cute tableware. I also passed by a second-hand tableware store where a pink teapot was displayed on the sidewalk. 🫖 It was incredibly cute.</p><p>At home, I felt a bit bored and started playing cards with my boyfriend. We used a deck of Crayon Shin-chan themed playing cards that we bought during our summer trip to Jeju Island. The designs on the cards are just too creative and cute. 🃏</p>",

At first, I was a bit confused, but after the teacher printed the first image using the machine, I felt I really made the right choice with this class.🥳</p><p>At weekend, I had a brunch with my boyfriend in La Mercerie. The restaurant is so beautiful, filled with flowers 💐and plants, and the food is great too. I will definitely come back!</p>",

I decided to buy a pair of boots, so I went shopping on Fifth Avenue and bought a pair of Chanel boots. In the evening, I went to Balthazar for dinner, where the duck confit is exceptionally delicious.😋</p>",

That day was their one-year anniversary celebration, featuring a preset menu that was so delicious. I think New York's Thai food really never disappoints.</p><p>That day was also a significant one, as it was the Mid-Autumn Festival. After dinner, as we stepped outside, the sky had darkened, and the moon was full and bright. 🎑 In China, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a day for family reunions, with the full moon symbolizing the coming together of loved ones. I bought some moon cakes.🥮 But I missed my family a lot.</p>",

I really can't resist these cute dishes.</p><p>Guess who I went to see in concert: Billie Eilish! ！She has been my idol since elementary school, starting from her song \"Six Feet Under.\" I've witnessed her transformation from a music-loving little girl into a Grammy-winning music superstar. Now, experiencing her concert in person, I was moved to tears, feeling incredibly emotional about the whole journey.</p><p>This week also marked a significant day, October 18th, the second anniversary🩷 with my boyfriend. I chose the Golden Salon at the Baccarat Hotel mainly for its atmosphere, though the food was just average. They even served a small cake at the end, which was a sweet touch to our celebration.</p>",
